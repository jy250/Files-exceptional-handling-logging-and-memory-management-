        "Reference Counting\n",

This is handled by Python’s internal mechanisms.\\n\\nReference Counting\\nPython keeps track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it means no one is using it, so Python deallocates (frees) the memory.\\n\\nGarbage Collection (GC)\\nBesides reference counting, Python uses a garbage collector to clean up objects involved in circular references (where two or more objects reference each other but are otherwise unreachable).\\n\\nMemory Pools (PyMalloc)\\nPython uses a private heap managed by the Python memory manager. Within this, it uses PyMalloc, a specialized allocator for small objects, to optimize performance.\\n\\nDynamic Typing\\nPython’s dynamic typing affects memory usage because types and sizes of objects are determined at runtime.\\n\\n\\n\""
